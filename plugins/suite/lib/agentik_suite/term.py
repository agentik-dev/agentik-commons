"""term: the one writer. Every byte a person reads leaves through here, by message id.

Each stream is judged alone, by isatty: on a terminal a status is a glyph, colour may be on, and
a table is laid out to the width (`COLUMNS`, else the terminal's own): a long cell wraps inside
its column and a path or a command that does not fit goes whole under its row, so neither is cut; off one a status is a word (ok, warn, FAIL, note), with no escape
byte and no redraw. NO_COLOR set to a value,
TERM=dumb or --no-color turns colour off; the glyphs stay. Columns are left-aligned, two spaces
apart; a name is bold, a path or a hint dim; nothing is told by colour alone.

A stream that is closed, or whose reader has gone, takes nothing more and raises nothing, at a
write or at the interpreter's exit; a character a stream cannot encode is replaced; a value has
its control characters (C0, DEL, C1) removed, so no file or variable puts an escape byte out; a
tab or a line break in it is one space, and the line and direction controls (U+2028, U+2029,
U+202A to U+202E, U+2066 to U+2069) are removed.
