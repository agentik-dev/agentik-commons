# Nice to have: overflow

The oldest S4 rows of `NICE_TO_HAVE.md`, moved here, appended, when that file reaches recordlint's bound. Each row is still open; a packet that touches an area greps it by path.

## From packet c3

| id | level | area | finding | evidence | from |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| n2 | S4 | `scripts/recordlint` | a near-miss header is skipped in HANDOFF as in NICE (`status` for `state`, a NICE of four cells), rule 1 as written, so a botched conversion passes; a header opening `#` or `id` could be held instead | design/05 §4 rule 1; `tests/test_recordlint.py`, the skip test's NICE | 2026-11-01, c3's builder; HANDOFF named by c3's refuter round 1 |
| n3 | S4 | `scripts/recordlint` | `item` over 80 characters, which the reader trims (`backlog.py:275`), and `id` not `n<k>` (design/05 §2) pass unchecked | design/05 §2 | 2026-11-01, c3's builder |
| n5 | S4 | `scripts/recordlint` | a `<br>` or a list inside a cell passes unchecked, though GUIDE §9's Cells rule is one line, no list, no `<br>` | `GUIDE.md:75` | 2026-11-01, c3's refuter round 1 |
| n6 | S4 | `scripts/recordlint` | bullets above the first `##` pass, rule 2 holding only the lines under a `##`, though design/05 §2's shape is a title and one head paragraph | `GUIDE.md:75`; `scripts/recordlint:171` | 2026-11-01, c3's refuter round 1 |

## From packet h1 (commit range)

| id | level | area | finding | evidence | from |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| n8 | S4 | `scripts/hygiene` | `--commits` never reads a merge's diff (R7), so a line an evil merge adds that neither side holds goes unscanned; `--diff-merges=cc` lines could be scanned once | `design/packets/h1-commit-range.md` R7, §4 | 2026-11-09, packet h1 |
| n9 | S4 | `scripts/hygiene` | `--commits` scans messages, not the author and committer headers, which a push publishes too | `design/packets/h1-commit-range.md` §4 | 2026-11-09, packet h1 |
| n10 | S4 | `scripts/hygiene` | `--commits` misses a term in a UTF-16 file whose first NUL lies past git's 8000-byte binary probe: git diffs it as text, its `+` lines read as UTF-8; the tree scan finds it | the refuter's `p5`: `MISS UTF-16 BOM, first NUL past 8000 exit=0`, the tree scan of the same file `exit=1` | 2026-11-09, h1's refuter round 1, F5 |
| n11 | S4 | `scripts/hygiene` | a NUL in a commit message (an object made with `hash-object --literally`) cuts `%B` at the NUL, so a term after it is not scanned | the refuter's `p10`: `MISS NUL in a message before the term exit=0`, then `cat-file holds the term: True` | 2026-11-09, h1's refuter round 1, F6 |
